# Analyzing PyBer Ridesharing Data

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to determine how the total weekly ridesharing ride fares differed between urban, suburban, and rural cities. Using python pandas and matplotlib, weekly fare trips from January 1, 2019 - April 30, 2019 for the three city types were calculated and visualized on a line graph. Data from the city_data.cvs and ride_data.cvs, which includeS data on pyber trips and drivers for several cities over a 4 month period, was analyzed to build these insights.

## Results 
Among the 3 city types, urban cities had the highest total weekly fares from January 1, 2019 - April 30, 2019 as shown in figure 1 below. Urban city weekly fares sat between $1661.68 and $2470.93. In comparison, rural cities had the lowest total weekly fares, as weekly totals ranged between $67.65 and $501.24.  In addition, suburban weekly fares ranged between $721.60 and $1412.74. 

Comparing ride data, urban cities had the highest total rides (1625), while rural cities had the lowest total of 125 total rides. Suburban cities had a total of 625 rides taken. Looking at driver data, urban cities had more than 30x the drivers (2405) than rural cities (78) and almost 5x more than suburban cities (490 drivers in suburban cities).

However, average fares per ride and average fares per driver are significantly different for urban cities ($24.53	and $16.57) respectively, than for rural cities, where average fare per ride and per driver is $34.62 and $55.49 respectively. For suburban cities, average fare per ride was $30.97 and average fare per driver was $39.50.

Finally, total ride fares for urban cities ($39,854.38) was alomst 10x that of rural cities total fares ($4,327.93). Suburban cities fall in between the two, with a total fare of $4,327.93.

## Summary 
provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types:
Based on this data, to address the disparities between the 3 city types, the CEO should consider increasing the number of drivers there are in rural cities. Because of the scarcity of drivers,
